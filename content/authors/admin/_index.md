I am a Project Associate (Research) in Machine Learning Lab (with Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems) in Indian Institute of Science advised by [Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/).

My research interests include generative models, model explainability, medical imaging, LiDAR/3D computer vision and autonomous vehicles. I broadly work on unsupervised learning (generative models, disentanglement, domain adaptation), explainable models, AI for healthcare (disease classification/segmentation) and robotics (LiDAR, SLAM). Some of these projects are in collaboration with [Tata Motors](https://www.tatamotors.com/), [Ati Motors](https://www.atimotors.com/) and [Niramai](https://www.niramai.com/).


I regularly organize talks for ML/Autonomous Navigation Paper Reading Group ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbBjZEwyU7W3lb0U0ZRA95QoKHrh4shX2)). I also work part time as Research Mentor at [SHARE Labs](https://sharelabs.in/) where we help students from private colleges to publish research papers in prestigious conferences/journals. Prior to this, I have worked on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing research projects at [Donut Research Labs](https://icecreamlabs.com/) and have worked on large software codebases at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/), Bangalore.
