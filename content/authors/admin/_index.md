I am a Research Associate in [Machine Learning Lab](http://mllab.csa.iisc.ernet.in/) with [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems (RBCCPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) in [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/). I am advised by [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/), [Department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA)](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), IISc Bangalore.

I am currently working to adapt SLAM in dynamic environments for "lifelong SLAM" in collaboration with [Dr. Vinay V](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ainvvy/), former CSA faculty and from [Ati Motors](https://www.atimotors.com/). I am also building real time, frugal Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for driving on Indian urban roads in collaboration with [Prof. Soma Biswas](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/soma.biswas/index.html), [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/), IISc Bangalore  and [Tata Motors](https://www.tatamotors.com/). I also conduct ML/Autonomous Navigation Paper Reading Group where we deliver talks on latest research papers.

My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and robotics. My enthusiasm lies in building interpretable lifelong learning models that can be incorporated in the context of NLP and robotics.

I obtained my Master of Technology in Computational Science from the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) and my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from [Mechanical Department](http://www.svnit.ac.in/web/department/mechanical/mechanical_dept.php), [Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat](http://www.svnit.ac.in/). Prior to this, I have worked on NLP research projects at [Donut Research Labs](https://icecreamlabs.com/) and have worked on large system software codebases at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/), Bangalore.
