I am a Research Associate in Machine Learning Lab in Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore advised by [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/). I am also affiliated to ARTPARK as a Consultant.

I will be joining as a Ph.D. student at MILA and Université Laval in fall 2021 under [Prof. Christian Gagné](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~cgagne/english.html), MILA & Université Laval. I will also be co-advised by [Prof. Frédéric Precioso](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso/), INRIA & Université Côte d'Azur.

My research interests include generative models, model explainability, medical imaging, LiDAR/3D computer vision and autonomous vehicles. I am currently working on unsupervised learning (generative models, disentanglement, domain adaptation), explainable models, AI for healthcare (disease classification/ segmentation) and robotics (LiDAR, SLAM). For more information, check out my [Research Works](/publication) or [Explore by Keywords](/#tags) below.


I also regularly organize talks for ML/Autonomous Navigation Paper Reading Group ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbBjZEwyU7W3lb0U0ZRA95QoKHrh4shX2)) and work part time as Research Mentor at [SHARE Labs](https://sharelabs.in/). Prior to this, I have worked on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing research projects at [Donut Research Labs](https://icecreamlabs.com/) and have worked on large software codebases at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/), Bangalore.
