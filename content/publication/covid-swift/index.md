# Abstract.
abstract = "We use state of art deep learning models to provide with likely COVID-19 and Pneumonia predictions. Our aim is to identify affected lung regions that can help doctors understand the severity of illness of their patients. COVID-SWIFT (Simple Whatsapp based Image interpretation at your Finger Tips) is a free Whatsapp based service to provide with swift diagnosis of potential COVID19 patients by analyzing Chest X-Ray images. We are running a small scale pilot where interested doctors within minutes, can receive a machine generated X-ray Report (as the one shown below) on sending us chest X-Ray of suspicious patients."
