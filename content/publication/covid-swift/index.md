# Abstract.
abstract = "XraySetu is a free Whatsapp based service to provide a swift diagnosis of potential COVID19 patients by analyzing Chest X-Ray images. Our state-of-the-art deep learning model generates a report containing predictions for COVID-19 and 14 other lung abnormalities with interpretable semantic markings on chest X-Ray. This can help doctors understand the severity of illness of their patients. Our model is trained using Multi-Task Learning on multiple chest X-Ray datasets by NIH, RSNA, etc. We ran a small scale pilot for the last 10 months, where interested doctors within minutes, could receive a machine generated X-ray Report on sending us chest X-Ray of suspicious patients. Previously known as COVID-SWIFT, it has now been launched as XraySetu, in collaboration between IISc, Niramai, and ARTPARK. Xraysetu is quick and simple for busy doctors to use. XraySetu allows doctors in rural areas to plan early intervention for their patients by simply taking a picture of their Xray and sending it over via Whatsapp. We believe that this could be the model for the future of Indian healthcare, accessible to everyone wherever one might be."
