# Abstract.
abstract = "Frugal ADAS for Indian Roads (FAIR) is an intelligent system designed as a plug-and-play software which can be integrated with any vehicle. FAIR was designed specifically for Indian roads, which have a different dynamic (animal presence, behaviour of pedestrians, high density of objects on road) as compared to European and American roads, to perform object detection with a competitively high accuracy while keeping development costs low. For testing, we collect our dataset on Indian roads (near IISc Bangalore) with webcam with objects in varying illumination and distances from the camera. We demonstrate that FAIR performs object detection, for 15 classes, exceedingly well in well-light conditions where average pixel value lies between 56%-62% (8AM to 6PM), object distance from the car lies between 0-30m, and the vehicle speed is in the range of 0-40km/h. FAIR can be augmented to use mobile cameras and can offer a great night time performance. It also has the potential to further support downstream tasks such as collision avoidance, blind spot information and speed breaker/pothole detections. With a competitive accuracy, high inference rate, ability to work in low-illumination settings, and low memory-footprint to run on the portable NVIDIA TX2 board, we conclude that FAIR is an ADAS system can be introduced in the Indian markets at a cost of Rs. 30,000 (or about 400 USD)."
