# Abstract.
abstract = "Precise localization of slow moving Unmanned Ground Vehicle or UGV in dynamic environments is still and open problem, limiting the adoptability of such self driving systems in crowded environments like manufacturing factories. We propose a novel grid based pose search algorithm which seeks to find the pose corresponding to maximum scan matching score in a discrete grid. We show that our approach significantly reduces the localization drift compared to existing approaches and creates sharper walls/3D structures in the generated map."
