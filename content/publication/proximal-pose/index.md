# Abstract.
abstract = "We propose a novel unsupervised scene flow prediction method that outperforms existing geometry based and learning based (supervised or unsupervised) methods. We show that our method outperforms state of the art learning based methods like Flownet3D++ on standard datasets like KITTI and demonstrate its effectiveness on self collected simulated and real world datasets for autonomous navigation. We further showed that our method can be used for improved performance for SLAM in dynamic environment."
