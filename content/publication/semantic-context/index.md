# Abstract.
abstract = "Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents. Convolutional neural networks provide an efficient method to constrain the complexity of feed-forward neural networks by weight sharing and restriction to local connections. In, this project we try to explore the power of the Convolutional neural Networks in feature extraction and eventually establish semantic relationship between object classes. We see various ways of visualizing this semantic relationship among object classes. We present a hybrid scheme, a combination of CNN and ANN, to bring out this semantic relationship. Using this semantic relationship and other factors, we go further showing how existing standard image classification algorithms can be improved."
